### QUESTIONS TO ASK FOR NEXT INVESTMENT
* Is the business a spawner -- compounding machine?
* Does the business have a long runway? Can it maintain growth momentum after 5 years? Is it in a sunrise industry?
* Does the business have the mindset of continuous improvement/learning e.g. research, new products, acquisition, new partnership, expanding market?
* Does the business have durable competitive advantages -- broad and deep moats -- e.g. IP, switching cost, brand?
* Is the management team trustworthy and capable -- in many aspects e.g. research, marketing, capital management, and connections?
* Is the management team working on diversification or diworsification?
* What are their advantages (and disadvantages) over competitors?
* How stable are income and cash flow?
* What is ROE? Is it high quality e.g. growing or stable at high level?
* Debt level?
* How does the business manage excess cash -- dividen, share buy-back?
* Is the price reasonable -- complies with your target return rate and provides a good margin of safety?
* What can go wrong? What would you do?
* Do you want to own this business? At least for the next 5 years?

### BAD

##### [China Resources Cement Holdings Limited](https://www.jitta.com/stock/hkg:1313/factsheet)
**Intro**: manufactures and sells cement, concrete and related products and services in Mainland China and Hong Kong.  
**Buy date**: 2021-02-08 (at 8.68 HKD)  
**Sell date**: 2021-05-25 (at 7.9 HKD)  
**Hold period**: ~4 months  
**Result**: -8.99% (not including dividen ~3%)  
**Journey**: 
* Decided to buy because of low PE (~6) and high dividen (~7%). Although not speculative, it has shown a steady growth in recent years.  
* Thought 1/PE + Div => 20% would be nice enough. Urban development in China should continue and this company should do well.  
Given its stable track record and it also has prepared its business line in prefabricated construction materials as a step toward a future trend. 
* I also thought PE will come back to around 8 (rough historical average) in a year or two year. And if the company can grow EPS at 5% annually -- that would be >40% return in two years.
* It went to 9.XX HKD in a few weeks but never exit because I did not make a valuation to set a target price.
* First quarter earning was up but not quite to the level of 1Q2019.
* Some bad signs started in April when local government in China started to slow down their bond salse. I had a feeling that it will affect local construction project such as buildings, roads, and railways. But I did not sell yet. Partly again because no price/return target whatsoever. But partly I wanted to wait for dividen record date.
* Stock price continued to drop slowly until a few % below my entry point but I thought it will not drop much after dividen record date.
* I was wrong. Price dropped below % of dividen after the record date. Do not assume other investors are not thinking the same thing.
* I decided to sell after that day. The price actually jumped back a few percents a day later. But eventually it continued to dropped down to below 6.5 HKD (2021-08-01)  

**Lessons**: 
* I should check other companies in the industry more thoroughly as well.  
There were other companies with an even better track record but also traded at low PE (such as China National Building Material Company Limited).  
This suggests the industry was not attractive as a whole at the moment.
* Thinking back, the industry also does not have a nice runway to run. So PE is not likely to expand.  
Another factor not to invest.
* I should find a way to exit quicker once I know I do not want to hold a business for long.  
News I gathered at the time told me to exit. I just waited for the dividen record date, hoping other investors would not dump the price that day.  
* Need to make a valuation to set a target price.  
And plan on what to do when the price drops e.g. what action to take at what level.
* Need to do more research on nature of the business and on the management team.  
Looking back, I did not have a good understanding of the business. And cannot judge competency of its management team.  


##### [Vinda International Holdings Limited](https://www.jitta.com/stock/hkg:3331)
**Intro**: manufactures and sells household paper and personal care products in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan, and internationally. Expanding base in ASEAN. Part of Essity Group -- a global hygiene and health company, with its headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden.  
**Buy date**: 2021-03-09 (at 23.30 HKD)  
**Sell date**: 2021-07-19 (at 20.55 HKD)  
**Hold period**: ~4 months  
**Result**: -11.8% (not including dividen ~1%)  
**Journey**:  
**Lessons**: 

##### [UDOW](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/udow/)
**Intro**: ProShares UltraPro Dow30 -- seeks daily investment results correspond to 3x the daily performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  
**Buy date**: 2021-05-07 (at 147.55 USD)  
**Sell date**: 2021-05-13 (at 134.90 USD)  
**Hold period**: 6 days  
**Result**: -8.57%  
**Journey**:  
* Wanted to get some quick profit after seeing Dow Jones and S&P500 keep hitting new high.
* Some influencers I follow also suggested to add a position in Dow Jones (mutual fund).  
But I want something fancier that can give a greater profit. So UDOW it is.
* They recommendation was for a medium term (3-6 months). While I was looking only to get 10% quickly. Probably a few weeks.
* Dow Jones stumbled a bit a few days after my entry point (2%-3%).
* I was afraid it could drop >5% => >15% loss for me with 3x leverage.  
*Fear crept in*.
* Decided to set my stop loss at 10%. But was not sure how to set it on my platform.  
I checked U30 future and thought UDOW will drop to -10% from my entry point at the opening.  
I then set an order to sell at market-price before the market opened.  
Thinking back, this action was because of *fear* that price will drop very quickly.  
I should have waited and be ready to act in this case.  
If UDOW drops at the opening, it will not be very different whether I set a sell order or wait to submit an order myself.
* Price dropped to -8.6% at the opening. My order was triggered. However UDOW went up and continued to go up.  
Although until July, I will never get +10% from my enry point. But I would not lose that much if I was more responsible in executing my trade.

**Lessons**:
* Tell yourself that things will not go nicely as you plan.  
* Do not think only what you hope to get in a short term. Think of what could go wrong and what you will do.
* Understand when you use a suggestion from another person. What are the differences in their objective and yours.
* Do not let fear take over. Keep your rational sense.  
I did okay at first trying to come up with an exit plan when things started to not look like what I hoped for.  
But I also let fear to make me set an order sooner than I should have.
* Be responsible for your trade. Study your tool well to execute your plan as accurately as possible.  
Do not be lazy and do whatever easier to do.  
* Do not trade a leveraged ticker until you plan both good and bad scenarios.  
Probably better not to trade a leveraged ticker (for me).
* Doing some research on stop loss and ETFs after exited CHAU also points out that I should not use stop loss here either.  
Error in this trade is due to both (a) my negligence toward my trading tool, and (b) my lack of understanding of how to trade an ETF.


##### [CHAU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHAU)
**Intro**: Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2X Shares -- seeks daily investment results of 200% of the daily performance of the CSI 300 Index.  
**Buy date**: 2021-03-16 (at 40.10 USD)  
**Sell date**: 2021-07-27 (at 34.707 USD)  
**Hold period**: ~4 months  
**Result**: -13.45%  
**Journey**:  
* CSI300 peaked in Feb, then sharply dropped, then stayed stagnant for about 2 weeks.  
Some experts recommend interested investors to start a position.
* I believed China will do well in the long run. And at least CSI300 should go back to ~5500 this year (~10% from CSI300 when I entered).  
Thought risk is low as China's economy is growing well.  
Decided to pick 2x leveraged ticker for CSI300. That is CHAU.  
Dreaming of getting >20% return in a year.
* An influencer I follow also made a tactical call on CSI300 a few weeks after my entry. I decided to use the tactical call as a reference to take profit or stop loss.
* The index stayed sideway for the whole period.  
Sometimes broke the sideway channel briefly, max 8% from my reference CSI300 entry point.  
CHAU went up ~16% at those times. But overall it stayed around +5% profit during the holding period.
* China market fell sharply during July 26-28. Because Chinese government announced a serious regulation policy for Online Education Industry.  
CSI300 fell below a reference stop loss target for the tactical call. Although the tactical call was not announced to close the position.  
Partly because Thailand had several holidays that week. And partly could be the influencer wanted to wait and see for the market to calm a bit more.  
However, I decided that I should stick with the stop loss target.
* I decided to set a stop order at -10% with respect to my entry point (properly not like the case with UDOW).  
Given the CSI300 movement that day, I thought CHAU will go down -3%, making my position to be -7%.  
But CHAU opened -9%, making my position -13% (-18% from my +5% last week).  
The stop order was triggered.  
* I had noticed that CHAU does not exactly follow CSI300 on the same day. But did not expect them to be this different.  
I should be more cautious about derivative tickers that traded at different timezones.  
People seem to use CSI300 (or China A50) future as a reference in this case.
* CHAU jumped back +9% next day. Oh well.
* CHAU continued to gain, on 2021-08-02 getting to -4% of my exit price.
* Further research reveals that setting a stop loss on an ETF is not a good idea. Even worse for a leveraged ETF.  
Since ETFs track an index, a strong drop in an ETF is likely due to an error in a bearish and illiquid environment.  
It will probably move back up to its real value soon.   
In such a time, you would want to increase your position, not sell. If you're using a stop loss, then you lock in losses.  
Worse, leveraged ETFs tend to open with a big gap on such days. Force you to sell below your stop loss price.
* Some good read here: [Are Stop-Loss Orders Good When Trading ETFs?](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/121815/are-stoploss-orders-and-etfs-good-idea.asp), [3X leveraged ETF with stop loss, am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/8nvr0c/3x_leveraged_etf_with_stop_loss_am_i_missing/), [What is the stop-loss strategy for a leveraged ETF?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-stop-loss-strategy-for-a-leveraged-ETF), [Is it possible to put a stop loss on an ETF?](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3tm4h5/is_it_possible_to_put_a_stop_loss_on_an_etf/), [some extra](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4351712-stop-loss-danger-to-levered-funds), [another extra](https://seekingalpha.com/article/133634-trading-leveraged-etfs-its-all-about-the-stops)  
* ([QUOTE](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/121815/are-stoploss-orders-and-etfs-good-idea.asp)) ETF Stop Loss Equals Big Risk, Individual Stock Stop Loss Equals Reduced Risk  
*The Bottom Line* -- When it comes to stop-loss orders, your approach should depend on whether or not you’re trading ETFs or individual stocks. With a typical ETF, a short-term plunge is the absolute worst time to have a stop-loss in place if you have the trend correct. Instead, this is where you want to step up and buy more.  
* That was quite a pricy lesson. It's time to suck it up and move on.

**Lessons**:  
* I think I did well sticking with the plan this time.  
Although lossing 18% with respect to only a few days prior does hurt.  
* In hindsight, the jump back next day makes me feel like I made a mistake.  
But we never know how a market would play out.  
It is better to limit your loss than hoping there will be a come back but it does not.  
If your position drops deeper, you might lose the will to act. Leaving your position to sink and sit there for a long time. 
* More importantly, better not trade leveraged derivatives -- especially if they trade at different timezones from their parents.    
Speculation could make the derived ticker to move very differently from its reference.  
Damaging your trade plan.  
* I should not aim for quick profit at the first place. Unexpected events can happen and you cannot guess how people would react.  
You also do not know actual value of the thing you hold. Only rely on a set target for stop loss (or take profit).  
* Next time stick with investing in a business you really want to own and grow with.  
This way, if an unexpected event happens, you can evaluate your business more reasonably and act more logically.
* Make sure you understand your instrument well.  
My research on stop loss and ETFs says the main cause of error this time is I do not understand the instrument.  
Although I did well on sticking with the plan, I set a stop loss where I should not.
