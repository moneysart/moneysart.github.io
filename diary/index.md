### INVESTING RULES

#### Legend: Warren Buffett
1. Never lose money
2. Never forget rule No. 1

#### Legend: Charlie Munger
- Do not go where you are going to die.

#### My rules
1. Do not act upon your immediate fear
2. Be patient; Do not play a game you are at a disadvantage
3. Make sure enough time and liquidity to fill your order
4. Do not set up an order when the market is open
5. Do not set up a trade when your are mentally unstable 
6. Never lose money
   
* In the end, these rules are my baby steps toward Charlie's and Warren's wisdom. 

##### Expansion of rules
1. **<u>Fear is not uncertainty</u>**.  
   Fear is short term. Uncertainty is long term. Long term uncertainty is normal. Just make sure there is enough margin of safety.  
   Common fear in trading: I will miss the train (price going up), exchange rate is moving to an unfavorable direction.  
2. It is better to not play the game entirely when you are at a disadvantage.  
   Do not let fear drive you to act.  
   Be patient and wait, opportunities will come again. It is favorable to be a waiter not a price follower.  
   Examples of disadvantageous conditions: exchange rate is above your comfortable level, trying to catch a stock that its price is moving up from your buy target.
3. Otherwise you risk losing minimum trading fee while can only fill part of your order.  
   This could accumulate to big losses. Deteriorate your return.
4. This greatly helps reduce the chance of you being controlled by fear.  
   Unless you review the first 3 rules and are confident that they complie. 
   Please consider delaying the act.
5. This help reduce the chance of making a series of bad decisions.  
   Especially when you are anxious, depressed, have recently made a series of misssteps.  
   It'd better not to risk feeling even worse with a bad trade setup.
6. You are already doing fine. Do not put yourself at risk needlessly.  
   The larger you have tirelessly saved up, the larger losses even with small bad decisions.
   
   
##### Hard learned lessons
- **<u>Do not lose money</u>**  
  I made a series of bad decisions in two weeks between `2022-07-25` and `2022-08-05` that caused at least ~400 USD and mental distress.  
  Not super big money but still significant considering it should have been prevented. 
  Nevertheless, they teach me a very good first-hand lesson. I am grateful for it. <br> 

  First, USD was getting stronger in the past few months. It was ~36.x THB/USD. Significantly beyond my comfortable exchange rate of ~33-34 THB/USD. I missed not DCAing THB to USD in the past few months because I was waiting to accumulate saving before exchange at once. Once I collected enough, I `feared` USD will get stronger. So I converted to USD at the peak THB/USD. Looking back `I should not play this game and just wait. I was at a currency disadvantage`. <br>

  Second, I was `too focused on and hoping for` US market contraction so I converted to USD (eyeing GITLAB at 40USD, was ~60USD). But that week another position I liked (Asininfo) started to drop to <13 HKD (my buy price is ~12HKD). Looking back I should have converted to HKD because Asiainfo was closer to my target price. `I should take likelihood of events into account`. <br>

  Third, I converted USD to HKD to buy Asiainfo when it dropped closer to 12HKD. However the conversion finished with less than 30 minutes before the market close. I rushed in `fearing` the price will go up. `Driven by fear, I was pushed to be at a disadvantage`. I immediate set up my trade order. `Did not think through if the order can be filled in time`. A very small fraction of my order was filled. I was `anxious`. Even worse, this added to my mental distress that had been going on in the past few days. I did not modify the order and let the remaining to get partially filled again the next day. `Losing minimum fees twice` without fullfilling my trade. Looking back, `I should not rush in` on the first day. I would set a much better order at night and will be likely to have it filled on the second day. It will still be better mentally even if the entire order is not filled on the second day and `keep all my money instead of losing to fees unnecessarily`. <br>

  In hindsight, exchange rate improved ~200USD (~2%) less than two weeks later, and I would gain ~260USD in few days if the intended position is filled properly (paying ~25USD trade fee). Only 1/3 of the intended position was filled and I paid trade fees twice. Hence, ~400USD loss. Not counting potential gain of shares in the future. More importantly, this series of mistakes caused me mental distress for almost a week. The only good thing is, I managed to reflect on them and learn a lesson.

- **<u>Whisper stocks</u>**  
  This type of stocks had been warned by Peter Lynch to avoid. I learned a lesson not following his wisdom. <br> 

  A good friend of mine shared a shortlist of stocks that insiders secretly mentioned they will go up roungly 20% after quarterly earnings in the coming months. I decided to join the party. Greed had lured me to ignore Lynch's warning. <br> 

  At first I bought only a little. Just to join the party with friends (all of us were cautious). But greed had won me and I doubled down the following week. <br>
  
  The stocks were mostly flat in the beginning. Then came their earnings. All were good except the stocks did not go up. They came down. It could be partly because the market also was going down. But these stocks suffered even more. <br>

  In the end, I decided to cut loss at ~25% down (~1500USD). That was a big lesson for me. <br>
  
  Not blaming anyone. Good friends just like sharing and having fun. A friend who shared still own the stocks after all of us decided to realize the damage. We all knew it was not a good approach to invest. But still ... <br> 
  
  Charlie's `Do not go where you are going to die` hits me at the time of writing this.
  
- **<u>Always be ready, at least continue to prepare for it</u>**  
  Because it is imposible to have all favorable conditions met at the same time, namely, fund for order, exchange rate, price target, macro environment (not super importnat but should think about). It is better to start preparing when some condition has already hit the target.

  For example, in mid 2022 I should have DCA on currency exchange when my target stocks moved close to a target range and the currency rate was good / acceptable. I was interested in Beijing Chunli, Pax Global, and Gitlab. I had done projection for all of them and already had a target buy price in mind. The stocks were already below that level.

  I did not have enough saving to buy. I decided to wait all together until I would save enough. Looking back, I should have DCA some on currency exchange, and also buy some shares even if wanted to buy more. A few months later when the saving was sufficient for one of them, the THB/USD exchange rate was more than 10% weaker and the stocks moved up significantly from their low after their good earnings calls (20%-50%). Not talking about their bottom. Just their average lows that maintained for a few weeks / months. 

  As of 2022-08, the price windows are no longer reasonable for me to invest. I `regret not making a better preparation to be as ready as possible`. 

- **<u>Be courageous</u>**  
  This lesson is connected to the previous one. Although I did not have enough free saving to act, I had a choice to withdraw capital from my mutual fund that I started to have less confidence in. I was not courageous enough. 

  Another lesson is that. I should `be more courageous to act`. Be courageous to switch from something I believe less in to something that is based on my own analysis.

  To add to this lesson, in early 2021 I did an in-depth research on Modern Dental Group but I decided to wait for their earnings call and bought shares of a more well-known company (Ping An). The earning was good. But I no longer had capital. The stock eventually went 7x after ~6 months. In the end it came down to ~3x. Although I doubt I will make 7x if I buy the stock, mostly will be 2-3x.
  Still, it was another `big lesson learned from not being courageous to act after a careful analysis`. 

- **<u>Do not wait for bottom</u>**  
  This lesson is linked to the previous one. People always want to buy at the bottom. In reality no one knows where is the bottom. 

  Although I did not have capital to buy. I follow stocks in my list regularly. I will use Gitlab as an example. In mid-2022 the stock was traded ~40USD, roughly my target price, after an earlier bottom. I think I would not buy the stock even if I had capital but rather wait for it to come back closer to the previous bottom. It did briefly then rose back to 40USD. If I had capital at the time, I will then again wait for it to come closer to the previous bottom. In the end, when I had capital around 2022-08, the stock is trading at ~60USD.

  Relfecting back, it will be much better to act rationally rather than to wish for it to bottom again. I think `when the stock is already below your target price and the market's sentiment is bearish, try setting an order (as a waiting order) at ~10%-20% higher than the previous bottom` should be good enough. For your long term return and your short term anxiousness.
  
  `If the market's sentiment is bullish, just set an order at your target price`. You will more likely to be happier in the long run.

### QUESTIONS TO ASK FOR NEXT INVESTMENT
* Is the business a spawner -- compounding machine?
* Does the business have a long runway? Can it maintain growth momentum after 5 years? Is it in a sunrise industry?
* Does the business have the mindset of continuous improvement/learning e.g. research, new products, acquisition, new partnership, expanding market?
* Does the business have durable competitive advantages -- broad and deep moats -- e.g. IP, switching cost, brand?
* Is the management team trustworthy and capable -- in many aspects e.g. research, marketing, capital management, and connections?
* Is the management team working on diversification or diworsification?
* Are founders still around? How much shares owned by insiders?
* What are their advantages (and disadvantages) over competitors?
* How stable are income and cash flow?
* What is ROE? Is it high quality e.g. growing or stable at high level?  Your long term return will be ~ROE (or ROIC).
* Debt level?
* How does the business manage excess cash -- dividen, share buy-back?
* Is the price reasonable -- complies with your target return rate and provides a good margin of safety?
* What can go wrong in my assumptions? What can make the buniness crumble? 
* Can the management team get the business pass unexpected downturns?
* What would you do if business deteriorates?
* Do you want to own this business? At least for the next 5 years?
* Timing (easier to guess for small cap stocks)? Try to buy when a stock is *light* -- low trade volume. If a stock is on a downtrend, wait for a drop to stagnant by observing trade volume.

### BAD

##### [China Resources Cement Holdings Limited](https://www.jitta.com/stock/hkg:1313/factsheet)
**Intro**: manufactures and sells cement, concrete and related products and services in Mainland China and Hong Kong.  
**Buy date**: 2021-02-08 (at 8.68 HKD)  
**Sell date**: 2021-05-25 (at 7.9 HKD)  
**Hold period**: ~4 months  
**Result**: -8.99% (not including dividen ~3%)  
**Journey**: 
* Decided to buy because of low PE (~6) and high dividen (~7%). Although not speculative, it has shown a steady growth in recent years.  
* Thought 1/PE + Div => 20% would be nice enough. Urban development in China should continue and this company should do well.  
Given its stable track record and it also has prepared its business line in prefabricated construction materials as a step toward a future trend. 
* I also thought PE will come back to around 8 (rough historical average) in a year or two year. And if the company can grow EPS at 5% annually -- that would be >40% return in two years.
* It went to 9.XX HKD in a few weeks but never exit because I did not make a valuation to set a target price.
* First quarter earning was up but not quite to the level of 1Q2019.
* Some bad signs started in April when local government in China started to slow down their bond salse. I had a feeling that it will affect local construction project such as buildings, roads, and railways. But I did not sell yet. Partly again because no price/return target whatsoever. But partly I wanted to wait for dividen record date.
* Stock price continued to drop slowly until a few % below my entry point but I thought it will not drop much after dividen record date.
* I was wrong. Price dropped below % of dividen after the record date. Do not assume other investors are not thinking the same thing.
* I decided to sell after that day. The price actually jumped back a few percents a day later. But eventually it continued to dropped down to below 6.5 HKD (2021-08-01)  

**Lessons**: 
* I should check other companies in the industry more thoroughly as well.  
There were other companies with an even better track record but also traded at low PE (such as China National Building Material Company Limited).  
This suggests the industry was not attractive as a whole at the moment.
* Thinking back, the industry also does not have a nice runway to run. So PE is not likely to expand.  
Another factor not to invest.
* I should find a way to exit quicker once I know I do not want to hold a business for long.  
News I gathered at the time told me to exit. I just waited for the dividen record date, hoping other investors would not dump the price that day.  
* Need to make a valuation to set a target price.  
And plan on what to do when the price drops e.g. what action to take at what level.
* Need to do more research on nature of the business and on the management team.  
Looking back, I did not have a good understanding of the business. And cannot judge competency of its management team.  


##### [Vinda International Holdings Limited](https://www.jitta.com/stock/hkg:3331)
**Intro**: manufactures and sells household paper and personal care products in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan, and internationally. Expanding base in ASEAN. Part of Essity Group -- a global hygiene and health company, with its headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden.  
**Buy date**: 2021-03-09 (at 23.30 HKD)  
**Sell date**: 2021-07-19 (at 20.55 HKD)  
**Hold period**: ~4 months  
**Result**: -11.8% (not including dividen ~1%)  
**Journey**:  
**Lessons**: 

##### [UDOW](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/udow/)
**Intro**: ProShares UltraPro Dow30 -- seeks daily investment results correspond to 3x the daily performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  
**Buy date**: 2021-05-07 (at 147.55 USD)  
**Sell date**: 2021-05-13 (at 134.90 USD)  
**Hold period**: 6 days  
**Result**: -8.57%  
**Journey**:  
* Wanted to get some quick profit after seeing Dow Jones and S&P500 keep hitting new high.
* Some influencers I follow also suggested to add a position in Dow Jones (mutual fund).  
But I want something fancier that can give a greater profit. So UDOW it is.
* They recommendation was for a medium term (3-6 months). While I was looking only to get 10% quickly. Probably a few weeks.
* Dow Jones stumbled a bit a few days after my entry point (2%-3%).
* I was afraid it could drop >5% => >15% loss for me with 3x leverage.  
*Fear crept in*.
* Decided to set my stop loss at 10%. But was not sure how to set it on my platform.  
I checked U30 future and thought UDOW will drop to -10% from my entry point at the opening.  
I then set an order to sell at market-price before the market opened.  
Thinking back, this action was because of *fear* that price will drop very quickly.  
I should have waited and be ready to act in this case.  
If UDOW drops at the opening, it will not be very different whether I set a sell order or wait to submit an order myself.
* Price dropped to -8.6% at the opening. My order was triggered. However UDOW went up and continued to go up.  
Although until July, I will never get +10% from my enry point. But I would not lose that much if I was more responsible in executing my trade.

**Lessons**:
* Tell yourself that things will not go nicely as you plan.  
* Do not think only what you hope to get in a short term. Think of what could go wrong and what you will do.
* Understand when you use a suggestion from another person. What are the differences in their objective and yours.
* Do not let fear take over. Keep your rational sense.  
I did okay at first trying to come up with an exit plan when things started to not look like what I hoped for.  
But I also let fear to make me set an order sooner than I should have.
* Be responsible for your trade. Study your tool well to execute your plan as accurately as possible.  
Do not be lazy and do whatever easier to do.  
* Do not trade a leveraged ticker until you plan both good and bad scenarios.  
Probably better not to trade a leveraged ticker (for me).
* Doing some research on stop loss and ETFs after exited CHAU also points out that I should not use stop loss here either.  
Error in this trade is due to both (a) my negligence toward my trading tool, and (b) my lack of understanding of how to trade an ETF.


##### [CHAU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHAU)
**Intro**: Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2X Shares -- seeks daily investment results of 200% of the daily performance of the CSI 300 Index.  
**Buy date**: 2021-03-16 (at 40.10 USD)  
**Sell date**: 2021-07-27 (at 34.707 USD)  
**Hold period**: ~4 months  
**Result**: -13.45%  
**Journey**:  
* CSI300 peaked in Feb, then sharply dropped, then stayed stagnant for about 2 weeks.  
Some experts recommend interested investors to start a position.
* I believed China will do well in the long run. And at least CSI300 should go back to ~5500 this year (~10% from CSI300 when I entered).  
Thought risk is low as China's economy is growing well.  
Decided to pick 2x leveraged ticker for CSI300. That is CHAU.  
Dreaming of getting >20% return in a year.
* An influencer I follow also made a tactical call on CSI300 a few weeks after my entry. I decided to use the tactical call as a reference to take profit or stop loss.
* The index stayed sideway for the whole period.  
Sometimes broke the sideway channel briefly, max 8% from my reference CSI300 entry point.  
CHAU went up ~16% at those times. But overall it stayed around +5% profit during the holding period.
* China market fell sharply during July 26-28. Because Chinese government announced a serious regulation policy for Online Education Industry.  
CSI300 fell below a reference stop loss target for the tactical call. Although the tactical call was not announced to close the position.  
Partly because Thailand had several holidays that week. And partly could be the influencer wanted to wait and see for the market to calm a bit more.  
However, I decided that I should stick with the stop loss target.
* I decided to set a stop order at -10% with respect to my entry point (properly not like the case with UDOW).  
Given the CSI300 movement that day, I thought CHAU will go down -3%, making my position to be -7%.  
But CHAU opened -9%, making my position -13% (-18% from my +5% last week).  
The stop order was triggered.  
* I had noticed that CHAU does not exactly follow CSI300 on the same day. But did not expect them to be this different.  
I should be more cautious about derivative tickers that traded at different timezones.  
People seem to use CSI300 (or China A50) future as a reference in this case.
* CHAU jumped back +9% next day. Oh well.
* CHAU continued to gain, on 2021-08-02 getting to -4% of my exit price.
* Further research reveals that setting a stop loss on an ETF is not a good idea. Even worse for a leveraged ETF.  
Since ETFs track an index, a strong drop in an ETF is likely due to an error in a bearish and illiquid environment.  
It will probably move back up to its real value soon.   
In such a time, you would want to increase your position, not sell. If you're using a stop loss, then you lock in losses.  
Worse, leveraged ETFs tend to open with a big gap on such days. Force you to sell below your stop loss price.
* Some good read here: [Are Stop-Loss Orders Good When Trading ETFs?](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/121815/are-stoploss-orders-and-etfs-good-idea.asp), [3X leveraged ETF with stop loss, am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/8nvr0c/3x_leveraged_etf_with_stop_loss_am_i_missing/), [What is the stop-loss strategy for a leveraged ETF?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-stop-loss-strategy-for-a-leveraged-ETF), [Is it possible to put a stop loss on an ETF?](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3tm4h5/is_it_possible_to_put_a_stop_loss_on_an_etf/), [some extra](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4351712-stop-loss-danger-to-levered-funds), [another extra](https://seekingalpha.com/article/133634-trading-leveraged-etfs-its-all-about-the-stops)  
* ([QUOTE](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/121815/are-stoploss-orders-and-etfs-good-idea.asp)) ETF Stop Loss Equals Big Risk, Individual Stock Stop Loss Equals Reduced Risk  
*The Bottom Line* -- When it comes to stop-loss orders, your approach should depend on whether or not you’re trading ETFs or individual stocks. With a typical ETF, a short-term plunge is the absolute worst time to have a stop-loss in place if you have the trend correct. Instead, this is where you want to step up and buy more.  
* That was quite a pricy lesson. It's time to suck it up and move on.

**Lessons**:  
* I think I did well sticking with the plan this time.  
Although lossing 18% with respect to only a few days prior does hurt.  
* In hindsight, the jump back next day makes me feel like I made a mistake.  
But we never know how a market would play out.  
It is better to limit your loss than hoping there will be a come back but it does not.  
If your position drops deeper, you might lose the will to act. Leaving your position to sink and sit there for a long time. 
* More importantly, better not trade leveraged derivatives -- especially if they trade at different timezones from their parents.    
Speculation could make the derived ticker to move very differently from its reference.  
Damaging your trade plan.  
* I should not aim for quick profit at the first place. Unexpected events can happen and you cannot guess how people would react.  
You also do not know actual value of the thing you hold. Only rely on a set target for stop loss (or take profit).  
* Next time stick with investing in a business you really want to own and grow with.  
This way, if an unexpected event happens, you can evaluate your business more reasonably and act more logically.
* Make sure you understand your instrument well.  
My research on stop loss and ETFs says the main cause of error this time is I do not understand the instrument.  
Although I did well on sticking with the plan, I set a stop loss where I should not.
